# AISimplified
This code originated from my thoughts on how a non-axiomatic logical system might work. Or rather it is an attempt
to code up a logical system that can interpret axiomatic statements without having seen they symbols or patterns
they're used in before. This is just a simplified thing, meant to recognize patterns and patterns of the patterns,
and eventually patterns with a few elements changed or missing or added.
